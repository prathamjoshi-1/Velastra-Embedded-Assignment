# 📘 Embedded Systems Assignment (C Language)

This repository contains the assignment implementation focused on **embedded system fundamentals**, including **I2C sensor handling**, **fault recovery**, and **data structure design** using the **C programming language**.

## 🧩 Problem 1: I2C Sensor Handling on Raspberry Pi (Mock Implementation)

### 🔧 Design Decisions
- 🧪 **Mock Sensor Model**  
  A software-based sensor (`MockSensor`) is used to simulate an actual I2C device, allowing validation of firmware logic without physical hardware.

- 🔄 **State Machine Architecture**  
  The system operates in two well-defined states:
  - `STATE_OPERATIONAL`: Normal sensor polling
  - `STATE_RECOVERING`: Handles sensor disconnection and recovery

- ⏱️ **Fixed Polling Interval**  
  Sensor data is polled every **500 ms**, reflecting common embedded system timing constraints.

- ⚠️ **Fault Injection & Handling**  
  Randomized logic simulates:
  - I2C bus timeouts
  - Invalid sensor data
  - Runtime sensor disconnection  
  Each fault is logged with a timestamp.

- ♻️ **Graceful Recovery**  
  The system automatically attempts sensor reinitialization without terminating execution.

- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Conditional compilation enables execution on both **Windows** and **Linux/Raspberry Pi** environments.

# 🧩 Problem 2: Stack Implementation in C (Linked List)

This module implements a **stack data structure using a linked list** to store **sensor error codes** generated by an embedded system.  
The design follows strict constraints commonly found in firmware development environments.

---

## 🔧 Design Decisions
- 🧱 **Linked List Based Stack**  
  A linked list is used instead of an array to demonstrate dynamic memory handling and clear node-based logic.

- 🔢 **Fixed Maximum Size (32 Nodes)**  
  The stack is capped at **32 entries** to reflect memory constraints typical in embedded systems.

- 🔁 **Circular Overflow Behavior**  
  When the stack reaches its maximum capacity, the **oldest entry is removed** before inserting a new one, ensuring that the most recent error data is always retained.

- 🚫 **Non-Recursive Implementation**  
  All stack operations are implemented iteratively to comply with the “no recursion” requirement.

- 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling**  
  The implementation safely handles:
  - Stack underflow conditions
  - Dynamic memory allocation failures

- 🧩 **Separation of Logic**  
  Stack initialization, push, pop, overflow handling, and display logic are clearly separated for better readability and maintainability.
