# 📘 Stack Implementation in C 

## 🧭 Overview

This project focuses on implementing a robust, non-recursive stack data structure in C using a linked list. The stack is specifically designed to store sensor error codes in embedded or low-level systems where memory control, predictability, and reliability are critical.

A special circular behavior is implemented to handle stack overflow gracefully by overwriting the oldest entry.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Design and implement a stack in C using a linked list that can store sensor error codes. The stack must operate without recursion, enforce a fixed maximum size, and safely handle overflow conditions.

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

🧱 Data Structure

Stack implemented using a linked list

Each node represents a sensor error code

No recursive logic is allowed


📏 Constraints

🔢 Maximum Stack Size: 32 nodes

🚫 Stack growth beyond this limit must not crash the system
